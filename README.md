# Holy Goose Slack Bot

This is a Slack bot with natural language processing that can send magic WOL packets to local computers.

It requires some environment variables to work properly:
```
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=...
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=...
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=...
```

It can respond in some other ways to messages too, just because I thought it was funny...
